helpers/: Contains utility functions that assist in performing common tasks, but aren't directly tied to UI components.

hooks/: Contains custom React hooks. These allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions.

lib/: Contains code that's not component-specific. It can also contain backend logic, especially if you're using Next.js in a full-stack manner.

middleware/: If you're using the API routes of Next.js, middleware functions can be used to run before an API request.

models/: If you're using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) like Prisma, Sequelize, or TypeORM, you might define your data models or entities here.

tests/: Contains different types of tests like unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

utils/: Contains utility functions or constants that don't necessarily fit into helpers. The distinction between helpers and utils can be subjective, and some projects might use one term over the other, or use them interchangeably.











assets/: For non-public assets that might need processing before being served, like raw SVGs or images that you want to optimize.

context/: If you're using the React Context API, you might have files defining your context providers and consumers here.

database/: For database setup, migration scripts, and seed data.

docs/: Documentation for the project, including architecture decisions, component usage guides, etc.

locales/: If you're internationalizing your app, you might have translations and locale configurations here.

middlewares/: For any middleware you'd use, especially if your Next.js project interfaces directly with databases or has more complex server-side operations.

plugins/: Some projects have plugins or extensions that add functionality.

server/: If you're running a custom server alongside Next.js (e.g., a custom Express server).

services/: Logic related to external services or APIs.

state/: If you're using state management libraries like Redux or MobX, you might organize your store, actions, and reducers here.

types/: When using TypeScript, you might have a directory dedicated to type definitions.

scripts/: Custom scripts, for example, for deployment, database migrations, or other operations.

graphql/: If you're using GraphQL, you might have your schema, resolvers, and other related files here.

migrations/: Database migration scripts, if you're using an ORM that supports migrations.

seed/: Seed data scripts to populate the database with initial data.

log/: Any log files or logging configurations.

errors/: Custom error classes or error handling logic.
